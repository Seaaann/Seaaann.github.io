# Collections

<br>I have been collecting studying resources widely (from the internet), mostly about mathematics, econometrics, machine learning and associated applications in economics. The files ranges from basic to advanced levels. I hope to share the files and save some local space.


## Econometrics Basics

- [EconBasic Notes](https://seaaann.github.io/file/collections/Basics/econ372lec1.pdf)
- [Mostly Harmless Econometrics: An Empiricist√≠s Companion](https://seaaann.github.io/file/collections/Basics/Angrist&Pischke.pdf)
- [Basic Financial Econometrics](https://seaaann.github.io/file/collections/Basics/Basic_Financial_Econometrics.pdf)


## Other Topics
